ðŸ“¦ How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-before-chill.git


Open index.html in your browser.

ðŸ’¡ How It Works

Course Cards are generated from a JavaScript array of course objects.

Clicking the "Click Here" button toggles the course description.

The Courses Table is populated dynamically from the same course array.

Clicking a table row highlights it and both its cells.

Navbar links trigger an alert showing the link name.
